        {question : "how to improve the debugging skills?",
        answer: `Debugging is an essential skill for any programmer, as it allows you to identify and fix issues in 
        your code. Here are some tips on how to improve your debugging skills:
        Practice: Debugging is a skill that requires practice to develop. The more you debug, the better you'll become at
         it. Try to actively seek out and solve bugs in your code, and work on projects that challenge your debugging skills.
        Understand the problem: Before you start debugging, it's important to understand the problem you're trying to solve.
         Take the time to reproduce the issue and gather as much information as possible about it. 
        This will help you narrow down the root cause of the problem and come up with a solution more quickly.`},
        {question : "how to improve the user debuging tools?",
        answer: `Use debugging tools: Most programming languages and development environments have built-in debugging tools
         that can help you identify issues in your code. Familiarize yourself with these tools and learn how to use them
          effectively.`},
        {question : "how to improve the Break the problem down?",
        answer: `Break the problem down: Debugging can be overwhelming, especially when dealing with complex issues.
         Break the problem down into smaller pieces and tackle each piece individually. This will 
        help you focus your efforts and make the problem more manageable.`},
        {question : "Check your assumptions",
        answer: `Debugging often involves identifying incorrect assumptions or misunderstandings about how your code works. 
        Double-check your assumptions and test them to make sure they're correct.`},
